# UnitedScratchMoney

This is a project aiming to make it easy to exchange currencies between various Scratch currencies.  

<span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">Current stage: Planning</span>

## Currencies on board:

- Blockcoins = yes
- Bytebank = maybe
- ECKoins = yes

---

## Possible Methods:

1. Create balance-modifying APIs for all currencies and give each other access.
2. Make all projects detect comments on a specific project and update balances based on what transactions people do in the comments.

I, Coockat444, personally prefer option 2, but it would require more work from all of us (not too much though).
