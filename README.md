# UnitedScratchMoney

This is a project aiming to make it easy to exchange currencies between various Scratch currencies.

**Current stage: Waiting on APIs**

---

## Currencies on board:

*   Blockcoins = yes
*   Bytebank = maybe
*   ECKoins = yes

---

## Progress:

It is mostly done, we just need to get APIs for all the currencies. Ensure when you create your APIs that you only give subtract and add access to the currency owners and not everyone.

## Possible Methods:

1.  Create balance-modifying APIs for all currencies and give each other access.
2.  Make all projects detect comments on a specific project and update balances based on what transactions people do in the comments.
3.  Make a project with cloud requests for clicking and stuff. (Currently working on it)

I, Coockat444, personally prefer option 2, but it would require more work from all of us (not too much though).
