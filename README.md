# UnitedScratchMoney
This is a project aiming to make it easy to exchange currencies between various scratch currencies. 
Current stage: Planning

Currencies on board:
Blockcoins=yes
Bytebank=Maybe
ECKoins=Yes

Possible Methods:

1. Create balance modifying apis for all currencies and give each other acesss
2. Make all projects detect commetns on a specific project and update balances based on what transactions people do in the comments

If any of you have ideas for how to do this, please let me know at: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/669020072/
